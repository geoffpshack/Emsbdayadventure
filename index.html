And the jungle fire was burning,
Down the track came a hobo hiking,

I&#39;m headed for a land that&#39;s far away
Besides the crystal fountains
So come with me, we&#39;ll go and see

In the B&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;i&lt;/font&gt;g &#39;ol Laundry Mountains,
There&#39;s a land that&#39;s fair and bright,
Where the handouts grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night
Where the boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
On the birds and the bees
And the ci&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;g&lt;/font&gt;arette trees

In the Big &#39;ol Laundry Mountains

And the barns are full of hay

And of whiskey, too
You can paddle all around &#39;em
In a big canoe
In the Big &#39;ol Laundry Mountains
In the Big &#39;ol Laundry Mountains,

And you can walk right out again,
As soon as you are in
There ain&#39;t no short-handled shovels,
No axes, saws or picks,
